//STEP 1 - 1.	Write a function called halfNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
function halfNumber(number) {
   
}
window.console.log("Half of 5 is 2.5.");

// ADVANCED AGRUMENT EXAMPLE
/*
function calculate(numbers) {
    let base = Number(numbers);
    let i;
    let (i = 1; i < arguments.lengs; i += 1) {
base += Number (arguments[i]);
   
document.write("The calculation remainit " + base);
}
calculate(10, 10, 200);
*/




//  window.alert("Half of 5 is 2.5.");

//STEP 2 - 2.	Write a function called squareNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
function squareNumber(number) {
    
}
window.console.log("The result of squaring the number 3 is 9.");
//STEP 3 - 3.	Write a function called percentOf() that accepts two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
function percentOf() {
    
}
window.console.log("2 is 50% of 4.");
//STEP 4 - 4.	Write a function called findModulus() that accepts two numbers. Within the function write a statement that returns the modulus of the first and second parameters. It should log a string like "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10."
function findModulus() {
    
}
window.console.log("2 is the modulus of 4 and 10.");
//STEP 5 - 5.	Create a JavaScript function that accepts a certain amount of numbers as parameters. Those numbers should be collected using a prompt and the numbers should be delimited by commas. Once the values are collected, find the sum of all of the numbers combined. You will need to use a function, loop, arguments object, and several type conversion global functions to accomplish this task.
