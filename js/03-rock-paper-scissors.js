// Rock, paper, scissors is a classic 2 player game. Each player chooses rock, paper or scissors. The possible outcomes include: •	Rock destroys scissors, •	Scissors cut paper., •	Paper covers rock. 
//1.	Begin by prompting the user for their choice.
//2.	Create the computer’s choice. This will be generated similarly to the coin flip that you did last week. Remember though, rather than 2 options, there will be 3 here.
//3.	Depending on what the numeric value of the computer’s choice is, reset it to a string value of rock, paper, or scissors instead.
//4.	Create a conditional that checks the user’s choice in relation to the computer’s choice. Once a winner is defined, display a message within an alert box indicating who the winner is.
//5.	What if the result ends in a tie? Figure out how to handle that as well.
//6.	What if the user enters something other than rock, paper, or scissors into the prompt? Figure out how to handle that as well.
